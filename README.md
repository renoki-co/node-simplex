## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. on GitHub aims on bringing a lot of open source projects and helpful projects to the world. Developing and maintaining projects everyday is a harsh work and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work. Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open source projects alive.
